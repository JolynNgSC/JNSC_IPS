# Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

The following research was conducted in 2023, focusing on Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and its processes. The aim was to comprehend the fundamental concepts of this specific cybersecurity management process.

## IPS Process

**Step One. Traffic Monitoring**

- The IPS constantly monitors network traffic, analyzing packets as they pass through the network.

**Step Two. Signature Matching**

- It compares the characteristics of the traffic against a database of known attack signatures, which are patterns that indicate malicious activity.

**Step Three. Anomaly Detection** 

- In addition to signature matching, some IPS systems also use anomaly detection techniques to identify abnormal behavior that may indicate an attack, even if it doesn't match a known signature.

**Step Four. Action** 

- When the IPS detects suspicious or malicious activity, it can take various actions to prevent the attack. These actions may include blocking the malicious traffic, alerting administrators, and/or reconfiguring network devices to mitigate the threat.

## Research Materials 

It's a network security technology that monitors network and/or system activities for malicious or unwanted behavior and can react, in real-time, to block or prevent those activities. IPS works by scanning network traffic and comparing it to a predefined set of rules or signatures that describe known malicious activity patterns.

IPS is often deployed alongside other security measures such as firewalls and antivirus software to provide comprehensive network protection. It helps organizations defend against a wide range of threats including malware infections, denial-of-service attacks, and intrusion attempts.

There are different types of IPS systems, including network-based IPS (NIPS), which monitors network traffic, and host-based IPS (HIPS), which operates on individual hosts or servers. Additionally, some IPS solutions are integrated into next-generation firewalls (NGFWs), combining IPS functionality with traditional firewall capabilities in a single device.
